# math.h
school 21 studying team project

int this project i have implemented together with my teammates the math.h library in C programming language in C11 standart.

code is checked for all possible memory leaks, conditional jumps and follows the Google Style.

all possible functions available in oririginal library are also available in our implementation and working perfectly.

you can check it by running our unit tests (make gcov_report), written using check.h library, that covers >95% of our code.
or simply view index.html file in report directory - it contains testing results.

hope you'll enjoy our work and waiting for your feedback!
